     <b > Our Founder‚Äôs Journey </b>  


    <br> <br>
    
    Our story begins with our founder, <b> Asish Majumder,</b>  who grew up with a love for cooking and a dream to bring authentic flavors to his hometown. During a trip to Calcutta, Ravi discovered his true passion for pizza. He spent months learning from master pizzaiolos in Naples, perfecting the art of pizza-making.
    
    Upon returning to Lumding, Ravi dedicated years to crafting the perfect recipes. In 2024, this yeaer, he opened <b>  PizzaüçïLite</b>  Lumding, and it quickly became a local favorite. Our pizzas are handcrafted with fresh, quality ingredients, from daily-made dough to house-prepared sauces and locally sourced toppings.
    
    <b>   PizzaüçïLite</b>  Lumding is more than just a restaurant; it‚Äôs a community hub where friends and families gather to enjoy great food and create lasting memories. Thank you for being a part of our journey. Welcome to the family!
